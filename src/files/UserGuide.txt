## Chatbot is displayed after 5 seconds

When first loading the website, the chatbot will not be visible. By waiting for 5 seconds, the chatbot will appear in the bottom right corner.

## Collapse the chatbot

Press the 'X' button located on the right of the titlebar of the chatbot. The chatbot will then minimise, leaving only the title bar and a button that, when pressed, will re-open the chatbot. The title bar is located at the bottom right hand corner of the web page.
